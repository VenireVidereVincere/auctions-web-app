# Auctions Web App by Alan Jurado for CS50 Web.

The whole project is written in Python, using Django. 
Remember to run python manage.py makemigrations followed by python manage.py migrate before attempting to run a local version of the app, otherwise it will not work as there's no database uploaded to the repo. 

The app allows you to create users, each user can then upload information to a listing page (Title, description, pricing, image, etc... ) in order to start a public auction. 

The listings are clasified by categories and you're able to leave comments and place new bids within each listing.
